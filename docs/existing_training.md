## Understanding Ontologies

---

### What is an Ontology?

An ontology is a formal representation of knowledge that specifies concepts, relationships, and properties within a specific domain, for example the industrial sector. It provides a shared understanding and common vocabulary for individuals and systems, facilitating knowledge sharing, interoperability, and reasoning.

### Why Are Ontologies Useful?

##### Knowledge Sharing
Ontologies encourage the creation of a shared understanding of some domain through a formal agreement between communities on the existence and definitions of concepts and relationships.

##### Data Integration
Ontologies enhance data interoperability by establishing a common framework for different systems to understand and exchange information. (ontology-based data access)

##### AI and Machine Learning
Ontologies provide a structured framework for organising and reasoning about data, thus are capable of enhancing AI and machine learning applications.

## Getting Started with Ontologies

---

The books **"A Semantic Web Primer"** by Grigoris Antoniou and Frank van Harmelen and **"Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist"** by Dean Allemang and James Hendler are both comprehensive guides to getting started with ontologies within the semantic web. The book **“An Introduction to Ontology Engineering”** by Maria Keet is another great resource that focuses more on the development of ontologies.

### Foundational Concepts
